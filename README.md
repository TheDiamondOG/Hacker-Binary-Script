# Hacker Binary Script
A random python script I made that generates 1s 0s and spaces to have a cool visual.\
This can be used as a cool party trick or to get some people who don't know what hacking is to think your hacking.
# Install
First clone the repository:\
`git clone https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/Hacker-Binary-Script`\
Then run the script\
`python3 binary_cool.py`
# How to use
1. Calabration: Put as many 0s as it take to make a line across your terminal and not longer than your terminal
2. Set the delay: I recommend 0.01 and 0.001 delays
3. Choose the random chance for a space it needs to be greater than 1
4. Enjoy
