# Hacker Binary Script
A random python script I made that generates 1s 0s and spaces to have a cool visual.
# Install
`git clone https://github.com/TheDiamondOG/Hacker-Binary-Script`
`python3 binary_cool.py`
# How to use
1. Calabration: Put as many 0s as it take to make a line across your terminal and not longer than your terminal
2. Set the delay: I recommend 0.01 and 0.001 delays
3. Choose the random chance for a space it needs to be greater than 1
4. Enjoy
